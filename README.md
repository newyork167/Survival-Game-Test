Survival Game Test
------------------

This project is based on the Epic Games unreal tutorial series with some major changes. Most of my changes are to the C++ code as I am a developer but I am also using this to learn about blueprinting and creating character meshes.

Feel free to make a copy and test new things out for yourself!

------------------

Third-person survival game for Unreal Engine 4 made entirely in C++. Originally built as a 6 section tutorial series, now available as open-source C++ sample project.
